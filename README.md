## Why build this?

These days, most websites and apps track data onto the end of any URL. As a result of this, websites can track and fingerprint users across the web. This situation is compounded when family or friends share the same URL, allowing companies to detail a complex profile of you and your social circle's interests.

We can do our best to reduce our use of these sorts of services but doing this every day can be time-consuming and inconvenient. A more significant solution to this problem is founded in a deeper migration away from these sorts of websites, but getting your entire network of friends and family to do the same can be tricky, to say the least.

Simple utilities like Untrack give the user more control over how they share information on the web. By stripping tracking information from any URL, it's a step in the right direction to living in a more privacy-aware world.
